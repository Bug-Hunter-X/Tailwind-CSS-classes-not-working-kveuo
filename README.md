# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not being applied correctly. The bug occurs when Tailwind directives are not properly configured in the project, leading to styles not being applied to the elements.

## Bug Description

When attempting to use Tailwind CSS classes in a React component, the classes are rendered as plain text instead of applying the corresponding styles.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the proper inclusion of the Tailwind CSS directives and configuration. This includes ensuring the correct import statement and potentially adjusting the Tailwind configuration file to match the project structure.
